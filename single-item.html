                    The first form prints the history event list. If n is given only the n most recent events are
                    printed or
                    saved. With -h, the history list is printed without leading numbers. If -T is specified, timestamps
                    are
                    printed also in comment form. (This can be used to produce files suitable for loading with 'history
                    -L'
                    or 'source -h'.) With -r, the order of printing is most recent first rather than oldest first.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With -S, the second form saves the history list to filename. If the first word of the savehist shell
                    variable is set to a number, at most that many lines are saved. If the second word of savehist is
                    set to
                    `merge', the history list is merged with the existing history file instead of replacing it (if there
                    is
                    one) and sorted by time stamp. (+) Merging is intended for an environment like the X Window System
                    with
                    several shells in simultaneous use. Currently it succeeds only when the shells quit nicely one after
                    another.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With -L, the shell appends filename, which is presumably a history list saved by the -S option or
                    the
                    savehist mechanism, to the history list. -M is like -L, but the contents of filename are merged into
                    the
                    history list and sorted by timestamp. In either case, histfile is used if filename is not given and
                    ~/.history is used if histfile is unset. `history -L' is exactly like 'source -h' except that it
                    does
                    not require a filename.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that login shells do the equivalent of `history -L' on startup and, if savehist is set,
                    `history
                    -S' before exiting. Because only ~/.tcshrc is normally sourced before ~/.history, histfile should be
                    set
                    in ~/.tcshrc rather than ~/.login.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If histlit is set, the first and second forms print and save the literal (unexpanded) form of the
                    history list.
                </p>

                <p> The last form clears the history list.</p>
